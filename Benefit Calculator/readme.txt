     The Social Security Benefit Estimate Program for Personal Computers

Description of program

The Office of the Chief Actuary, Social Security Administration, produces a 
Social Security Benefit Calculator. There are two versions of the interactive 
program: one works on IBM PC's and compatibles running recent versions of the
Microsoft Windows operating system, including Windows 7, Windows 8, or 
Windows 10. It is possible that it may work on older versions of Windows, but
we have not been able to confirm this ourselves. The other version runs under 
older versions of the MacOS. Either version produces the Social Security 
benefit for an old-age, survivor, or disability claim, given the 
characteristics of a particular worker (such as birth date, past earnings, 
and type of benefit). It also produces the "primary insurance amount" (PIA), 
"maximum family benefit", the actuarial reduction or increment factor (for 
early or delayed retirement), and the monthly benefit amount (MBA).

The benefit can be computed for either a new entitlement or a recomputation 
after initial entitlement. Several pages of output are printed in the 
application window, with summary results on the first page. Later pages 
display details of the benefit computation.

The calculator can produce a benefit for any historical case from the first 
monthly Social Security benefit paid (1940). It can also produce a projected 
benefit, based on standard or user-specified assumptions, through 2095. 
Although we have tried to be as accurate as possible, this is not the same 
calculator as is used for official Social Security calculations and it may 
produce results that differ from an official calculation. In particular, for 
primary benefits, we have made approximations for pre-1965 benefits and for 
the frozen minimum PIA, and we only partially take account of disability 
non-exclusion calculations.  In addition, the calculator is not set up to 
estimate dependent or survivor benefits in situations where the dependent 
or survivor also receives benefits on their own record, or survivor benefits
where the benefit is affected by the worker's retired worker benefit prior
to death.  Based on experience to date, this calculator matches the 
official calculations very well, with most differences due to late posting 
of earnings to the earnings record, or different assumptions for projected 
benefits.

The 2019.2 version, which takes all amendments to the law, and automatic 
adjustments, through 2018 into account, is now available from the Social
Security website.  It updates the 2019.1 version by updating the projected 
benefit increases and average wage increases with the assumptions from the
2019 Trustees Report.

Special note for the MacOS version

The MacOS version of the calculator is still under development. It has all 
the basic features that the Windows version has, and produces the same 
results for a given case. However, it is lacking the more advanced features 
of the Windows version, such as context-sensitive help. We hope to post 
updated versions as features are added.

In addition, the Mac version does not work on Macs running Lion or newer 
versions of the OS X operating system.  We hope to produce a Mac version 
which will work on newer version of OS X, but we have very limited 
resources to devote to that project at this time.  

Obtaining the program electronically

The program can be obtained from the Social Security website. Go to 
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/anypia for more information 
about downloading and installing the calculator.

Updating the program

You can keep the calculator up to date by adding the annually announced 
automatic changes to the benefit increases and wage-related amounts. Those 
figures are posted annually on the SSA website in mid-October at 
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/autoAdj.html. Or if you prefer, you can download
the new version of the calculator with the new amounts.

For developers only

The source code (in the C++ computer language) used to create the calculator 
is available at no charge. There is also a version of the calculator that 
runs as a console application, avoiding the complications and overhead of the 
code required to make the windows in the interactive version. For more 
information about the source code or the console version, go to 
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/anypia/source.html.
